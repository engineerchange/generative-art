# What is Generative Art?

# Origins

First known ***computergrafik*** (or computer art) comes from the 1968 thesis of George Nees.

<blockquote>
"Looking at the multi-patterned constructions in Nees' graphics, with their floating ellipsoids, crystalloid spheres and bizarre forms, one cannot help but acknowledge and appreciate their atmospheric and inspiration-inducing effects." - Eva Karcher

# Human Rules, "Machine" Run

Generative art is art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an **autonomous system**.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, fig.keep='all', fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
library(tidyverse)
library(mathart)
result <- kdtree(sample(mathart::points %>% head(1000)))

ggplot() +
    geom_segment(aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend),colour='white',data =  result) +
    coord_equal() +
    xlim(0, 5000) + ylim(0, 5000) +
    theme_void() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#272822',colour='#272822'))

# Algorithmic art

- Algorithmic art refers to computer-generated art.

--
- Algorithmic art is generative art, but generative art does not have to be algorithmic art.

--
- Algorithmic artists are called **algorists**.

--

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, fig.keep='all', fig.align='center', fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
library(tidyverse)
df = mathart::harmonograph(n = 10000)

ggplot(df,aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point(size=0.1,colour="white") +
    coord_equal() +
    xlim(-2, 2) + ylim(-2,2) +
  theme_void() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#272822',colour='#272822'))
# https://paulvanderlaken.com/2018/11/14/mathematical-art/

# Agar art

- Messy scientist and son of a pig farmer.

--
- Enjoyed painting cultures on petri dishes.

--
- Treated syphilis and had a lot of patients that were painters at St. Mary's in London.

--
- Kept his desk messy and left petri dishes everywhere on his lab benches.

--
- One day in September 1928, he returned from a trip to discover a goop growing into a stack of abandoned bacterial cultures and killing them.

--
- That circle of goop was fungus. 
- **Alexander Fleming** had discovered the antibiotic properties of what would become known as ***penicillin***.

# #genuary2021

Daily code prompts to make generative art in the month of "Genuary"

Examples:
- Jan 4. Small areas of symmetry.
- Jan 18. One process grows, another process prunes.
- Jan 22. Draw a line. Wrong answers only.
- Jan 29. Any shape, none can touch.

# NFTs, non-fungible tokens

--
- A non-fungible token means it is unique and cannot be replaced with something else.

--
- A good analogy is a baseball or Pokemon card. If you trade away the 1st print of a card, you no longer have that unique item.

--
- An NFT is a token. It is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger.

--
- The ledger is a blockchain and this ledger certifies that a digital file is unique.

# Why is it bad?

- Digital art is... digital. There's no stopping someone from copying and reproducing your art.

--
- Not good for the environment. 

--
- NYC consumes 143.2 TWh per year.

--
- Estimated consumption of ETH yesterday (4/26/21): 39.5 TWh per year

--
- Estimated consumption of Bitcoin yesterday (4/26/21): 106.4 TWh per year

# Why is it good?

New gateway for artists:
- Artists can get commission every time their work is re-sold.

--
- Musical artists have already jumped on board:
  - Eminem (over the weekend released art in his 'Shadycon').
      - One item is on sale for $100k right now.
  - Kings of Leon released their latest album as a NFT.
      - They made ~$2M from selling ~6,500 NFTs certifying a physical vinyl and digital download.

--
**It is about exclusivity and digital memorabilia.**
